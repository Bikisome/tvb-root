They are mapped to a generalized universal function (gufuncs) using Numba's guvectorize decorator to compile a pure Python function directly into machine code that operates over NumPy arrays, as fast as a C implementation (Numba, “Creating NumPy universal functions.”, https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/vectorize.html). An example of a Numba generated guvectorize function is displayed in Listing 2. In this example the gufunc *_numba_dfun_Epileptor* accepts two n and m sized float64 arrays and 19 scalars as input and returns a n sized float64 array. The benefit of writing Numpy gufuncs with Numba's decorators, is that it automatically uses features such as reduction, accumulation and broadcasting to efficiently implement the algorithm in question.\n",
